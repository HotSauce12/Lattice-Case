# Lattice-Case
Case made for Lattice PCB by u/emdarcher

Didn't really like the case already made for the Lattice PCB so I decided to make my own.

The images below are not updated but it's a rough sense of the design

- [] Fix up the dimensions and screws for the plateless design
- [] Add feet for both designs
- [] Possibly change screw holes in with plate design to accommodate standoffs (aesthetics?)
