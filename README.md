# Lattice-Case
Case made for Lattice PCB by u/emdarcher

Didn't really like the case already made for the Lattice PCB so I decided to make my own.

* L6 (clear acrylic cover) - 2mm thickness
* L5 x 2 - 3mm thickness (2 of this!)
* L4 (plate) - 1.5mm thickness
* L3 - 3mm thickness
* L2 - 1.6mm thickness (thickness of PCB)
* L1 - 3mm thickness
* L0 - 3mm thickness
