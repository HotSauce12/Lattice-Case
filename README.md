# Lattice-Case
Case made for Lattice PCB by u/emdarcher

Didn't really like the case already made for the Lattice PCB so I decided to make my own.

*L0 - 3mm thickness
*L1 - 3mm thickness
*L2 - 3mm thickness
*L3 - 4.5mm thickness
*L4 (plate) - 1.5mm thickness
*L5 x 2 - 3mm thickness (2 of this!)
*L6 (clear acrylic cover) - 2mm thickness
